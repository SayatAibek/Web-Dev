        <h1>The perfect trip</h1>
        
        <h3>Scenes</h3>
        <p>I would see scenes like the electrifying atmosphere at Old Trafford, home of Manchester United,<br>
             where tens of thousands of passionate fans cheer as their team takes the field.<br>
             The chants, the energy, and the iconic stadium would create unforgettable memories. </p>

        <h3>Animals</h3>
        <p>And animals like friendly foxes that roam the English countryside, birds like majestic swans gliding <br>
            along the River Thames, and, if I'm lucky, a glimpse of wild deer in the forested parks of Richmond or the New Forest. <br>
             Along the coasts, I might spot seals basking on the shores or puffins in their natural habitat on the northern cliffs.</p>

        <h3>Food</h3>
        <p>And eat food like traditional fish and chips, served in a cozy seaside pub with a sprinkle of malt vinegar, <br>
         or a hearty shepherd’s pie made with tender meat and creamy mashed potatoes. For dessert, I’d enjoy a classic sticky <br>
         toffee pudding or a warm scone topped with clotted cream and strawberry jam during afternoon tea. <br>
         A pint of local ale or a cup of Earl Grey would round out the experience perfectly.</p>
